# Welcome to My Lua Static Site

This is a demonstration of a static site generator built entirely in Lua. This site showcases the power and simplicity of using Lua for content generation and web development.

## Features

- **Markdown Processing**: Write content in Markdown and automatically convert to HTML
- **Frontmatter Support**: YAML-style frontmatter for metadata
- **Template System**: Simple template rendering with variable substitution
- **Fast Generation**: Leverages LuaJIT for quick site building

## Getting Started

## Why Lua?

Lua is an excellent choice for static site generation because:

- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint and fast execution
- **Simple**: Clean, readable syntax that's easy to understand
- **Powerful**: Full programming language capabilities when needed
- **Embeddable**: Easy to integrate with other tools and systems
